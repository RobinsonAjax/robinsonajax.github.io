Pigeon Products is a student-run company based out of Bellingham Washington. We pride ourselves on good work and fast service for our customers, bringing only a product we can put our utmost confidence in for the customer to enjoy for themselves. Since we started almost one year ago, we have worked hard to improve our quality and delivery times. If our work doesn't falter, the future of clothing may be a pigeon.<br>Some things we've wanted to improve on in the current clothing climate within schools is the lack of good design. We work with out customers to provide the best products possible, not only in functionality but also appearance. A few people we have done work for are;
        <ul>
        <li>
            Mrs. Styer, one of our first customers, a huge thanks to her for kickstarting some progress in the company!
        </li>
        <li>
            Sehomes own leadership class, thank you all!
        </li>
        <li>
            My grandfather has ordered some clothes, so thank you as well Gumpa!    
        </li>
            </ul>
Dang, listing that out made me feel pretty un-accomplished. Well, that was the history of this powerful company.
